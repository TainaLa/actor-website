		<h2 id="title">About Me </h2>

		<div class="left">
			<p>Emilio Evans is a (Native) New York City based actor with 9 years of experience from various acting coaches and teachers. He continues to push what is required of him as a performer all the while making progress through these great strides but most importantly being patient while trusting the process.<br>
			<br> He's a theatre trained actor who shaped and honed his skills to be able to hold his own in any form of media; whether it be the screen or the stage. <br> The key for him is giving as much of himself to his craft as he can by "doing work that gets work". His aim in both life as well as career is to continue to grow as a person and as a performer, always.<br> 
			<br>"Nothing can stop the man with the right mental attitude from achieving his goals, nothing on earth can help the man with the wrong mental attitude."</p>
